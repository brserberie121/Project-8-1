The Corner Grocer program is designed to analyze and report item purchase frequencies based on user input through a menu-driven interface. The program allows users to interact with the user the best way to check the stock of products and use the information to become more informed about their business, by providing valuable insights into item frequency and usage trends. The menu allows for straightforward navigation and interaction with the program.
Users can input an item name to determine how many times it appears in the dataset. For example, a query for "Potatoes" might return the result: "The item 'Potatoes' was purchased 4 times." This feature makes it easy to check specific items and their occurrences. The program lists all items alongside their purchase frequencies. This output is formatted for readability, with columns displaying the item names and corresponding frequencies. An example of such output might include items like Potatoes, Pumpkins, and Onions, each paired with their respective frequency counts.
I was able to utilize and efficiently use of the map container, which allowed for fast insertion and lookup operations. The user-friendly menu system provided a straightforward way to interact with the program, while the modular design made it easy to manage and maintain. The encapsulation of responsibilities, such as separating file I/O tasks into distinct methods, contributed to the program's clarity and robustness.
The challenges I faced when working on this project was handling file I/O and ensuring the integrity of data during loading and saving. I was able to solve this by separating these tasks into the LoadDataFromFile and SaveDataToFile methods, ensuring clarity and reducing potential errors. I utilzed the zyBooks activities which were vital in helping me develop the project.
The skills developed during this project are highly transferable. Proficiency in using map for efficient data management can be applied to other projects requiring frequency analysis or similar mapping tasks. Strengthened file I/O handling skills are essential for creating programs that rely on persistent data, and experience in designing intuitive menu-driven interfaces is valuable for developing user-friendly software.

To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, the program adhered to modular programming principles, encapsulating related tasks into clear methods. Meaningful variable names and comments enhanced readability, while the programâ€™s design allows for easy expansion, such as integrating new display options or input methods with minimal changes to the core logic. Overall, the project demonstrates a balance of functionality, usability, and potential for future growth.
